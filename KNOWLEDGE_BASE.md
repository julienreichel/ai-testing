# üß† AI Tester ‚Äî Knowledge Base

## Overview

**AI Tester** is a front-end-only Vue 3 + TypeScript application designed to test, compare, and validate prompts across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, Google Gemini, Mock). Built with Vite + Vitest, it evaluates model responses, measures cost and token usage, defines pass/fail rules, and runs statistical reliability tests ‚Äî all locally in the browser.

**Current Status**: Production v0.2.0 - 570/570 tests passing, 13+ UI components, complete data persistence (1,000+ batch runs), zero warnings.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

- Unified playground for testing prompts across different AI APIs
- Plug-and-play provider architecture for easy API integration
- Local API key storage without backend dependencies
- Transparent token and cost estimation
- Custom validation rules for automated output testing
- Batch testing and statistical analysis
- Future: AI-based evaluation for qualitative scoring
