# üß† AI Tester ‚Äî Knowledge Base

## Overview

**AI Tester** is a front-end-only Vue 3 + TypeScript application designed to test, compare, and validate prompts across multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, Google Gemini, Mock). Built with Vite + Vitest, it evaluates model responses, measures cost and token usage, defines pass/fail rules, and runs statistical reliability tests ‚Äî all locally in the browser.

**Current Status**: Production v0.2.0 - 570/570 tests passing, 13+ UI components, complete data persistence (1,000+ batch runs), zero warnings.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

- Unified playground for testing prompts across different AI APIs
- Plug-and-play provider architecture for easy API integration
- Local API key storage without backend dependencies
- Transparent token and cost estimation
- Custom validation rules for automated output testing
- Batch testing and statistical analysis
- Future: AI-based evaluation for qualitative scoring

## üß© Implemented Features

**Providers**: Modular system with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, Google Gemini, Mock. Secure localStorage API keys, real-time connection testing, complete CRUD operations.

**Prompt Testing**: Editor interface with system/user prompts, model parameters, response display (latency, tokens, cost), IndexedDB persistence.

**Rules Engine**: Automated validation with exact match, contains/starts/ends with, regex patterns, length constraints, AND/OR logic. i18n feedback messages.

**Test Management**: Project system with CRUD operations, execution history, export/import (JSON with ID preservation), conflict resolution, Quick-Run from test list, multi-select batch execution.

**Batch Runs**: Relational architecture (BatchRunSession/BatchRunResults), parallel execution (bounded concurrency), real-time progress, CSV export (RFC 4180), history (1,000 runs), enhanced sorting. _Planned: Statistical analysis, performance trending, A/B testing._

**Data & Storage**: IndexedDB for projects/tests/runs, localStorage for API keys/preferences, Pinia state management, export/import system, privacy-first (no backend).

**UI/UX**: BasePageLayout system (13+ components), dedicated views (TestsListView, TestDetailsView, TestQuickRunView, ProjectQuickRunView), reusable dialogs, responsive design.

## üîå Supported AI Providers

**OpenAI**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-5 (nano/mini/full). Chat Completions API.

**Anthropic (Claude)**: Claude 3.5 (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus). Messages API.

**Mistral AI**: Mistral family. OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API.

**Google Gemini**: Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash, 2.0 Flash (including lite variants). generateContent endpoint.

**Mock Provider**: Development/testing without API costs. Simulated responses, configurable latency.

**Provider Architecture**: Modular design with `BaseProviderAdapter` interface, full TypeScript support, standardized error handling, accurate cost estimation, unified response format.

---

## ÔøΩ Security & Privacy

- API keys stored locally in browser localStorage
- Direct API calls from browser to providers (no backend)
- Clear warnings about API key exposure and CORS limitations
- Optional personal proxy setup (e.g., Cloudflare Worker) for CORS issues

## üß™ Testing

**570/570 tests passing** - Boston School behavior-driven approach focusing on user experience

**Coverage**: UI components, views, database operations, import/export, composables (rules engine, cost estimation, prompt/batch runner, test management), parallel execution (task pool, bounded concurrency)

**Infrastructure**: Real i18n integration (production translations), IndexedDB mocking, zero warnings, type-safe with full TypeScript, Vitest with HMR
