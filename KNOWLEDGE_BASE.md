# 🧠 AI Tester — Knowledge Base

## Overview

**AI Tester** is a front-end-only Vue 3 + TypeScript application (built with Vite + Vitest) designed to **test, compare, and validate prompts** across multiple AI providers such as OpenAI, Claude, and Mock providers.
The app helps users evaluate model responses, measure cost and token usage, define pass/fail rules, and run statistical reliability tests — all locally in the browser.

### ✅ **Current Implementation Status**

We have successfully built a **production-ready application** with complete core functionality:

- **Complete provider management system** with secure local storage and real-time validation
- **Full test management system** with IndexedDB storage, CRUD operations, and data persistence
- **Export/Import functionality** for test projects with ID preservation and conflict resolution
- **Prompt editor interface** with real provider integration and response handling
- **Rules engine system** with validation logic and automated testing capabilities
- **10+ reusable UI components** following clean architecture principles
- **Comprehensive test suite** (383/383 tests passing) using Boston School behavior-driven approach
- **Full internationalization** support with Vue I18n and DRY principle compliance
- **Type-safe architecture** with strict TypeScript enforcement
- **Clean code standards** with ESLint, Prettier, and conventional commits
- **Perfect testing infrastructure** with zero warnings and IndexedDB mocking

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- Provide a **unified playground** for testing prompts on different AI APIs.
- Enable **plug-and-play providers**: new APIs can be added easily as modules.
- Let users **store their API keys locally**, without any backend.
- Offer **transparent token and cost estimation** for each run.
- Support **custom validation rules** to automatically test AI outputs.
- Allow **batch testing and statistical analysis** of result consistency.
- Later, enable **AI-based evaluation** for subjective or qualitative scoring.
