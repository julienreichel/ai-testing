# üß† AI Tester ‚Äî Knowledge Base

## Overview

**AI Tester** is a front-end-only Vue 3 + TypeScript application (built with Vite + Vitest) designed to **test, compare, and validate prompts** across multiple AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Mistral AI, Google Gemini, and Mock providers. The app helps users evaluate model responses, measure cost and token usage, define pass/fail rules, and run statistical reliability tests ‚Äî all locally in the browser.

### Current Status: Production v0.2.0

**Production-ready application** with complete core functionality achieving:
- 570/570 tests passing (Boston School behavior-driven approach)
- 13+ reusable UI components with unified BasePageLayout system
- Multi-provider support with parallel execution and bounded concurrency
- Complete data persistence with IndexedDB (supporting 1,000+ batch runs)
- Type-safe architecture with strict TypeScript and modern path mapping
- Zero warnings, perfect CI/CD, comprehensive documentation

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

- Provide a **unified playground** for testing prompts on different AI APIs.
- Enable **plug-and-play providers**: new APIs can be added easily as modules.
- Let users **store their API keys locally**, without any backend.
- Offer **transparent token and cost estimation** for each run.
- Support **custom validation rules** to automatically test AI outputs.
- Allow **batch testing and statistical analysis** of result consistency.
- Later, enable **AI-based evaluation** for subjective or qualitative scoring.
